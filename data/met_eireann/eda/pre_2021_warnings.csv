The rain, coupled with falling leaves may block drains and gullies, leading to surface flooding.\n\nCoastal:\nStorm Lorenzo will produce significant swell, high waves and sizeable storm surges. This will lead to wave overtopping, some coastal flooding and damage. \n\nSurface Flooding: \nSaturated soils and the expected heavy rainfall may lead to surface flooding. \n\nRiver:\nRiver levels are currently elevated across the country and the rainfall may lead to river flooding in parts of the midlands, west and northwest.
